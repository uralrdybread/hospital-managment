This is my first project using Firebase's FireStore for storage. The app when fully completed will be a management portal to add/remove doctors with patients on a schedule. Currently, it only has the ability to add/remove doctors to the cloud. Once a doctor is added to the system the data can be edited or removed fully. The doctors list can also be filtered through.
